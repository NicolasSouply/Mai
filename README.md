# Mai restaurant
Ma√Ø is a final year project at 3W Academy. I developed this website to showcase the restaurant and facilitate takeout orders and table reservations. It also includes a login feature and a back-end section for site management. This project is a training assignment and is not intended for commercial use. The images used in this project are not free to use and may be subject to copyright restrictions.

## Online Version
An online version of the site is available at: [mai-restaurant](https://mai-restaurant.alwaysdata.net/index.php?route=home)
